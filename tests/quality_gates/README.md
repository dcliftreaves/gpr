# Quality Gates

`gates.json` defines committed STILL, VIDEO_FREEZE and PREVIEW thresholds.
`test_set.json` fixes four source images, evaluation dimensions and crops.
Every image must pass; an average cannot hide a failing image.

## Run

Source paths resolve relative to `GPR_EXTERNAL_ROOT` (the repository by default).
Place original fixtures at the paths in `test_set.json`, or supply
`GATE_SOURCE_PATH_MAP` as described by the runner. External model identities
and supported combinations live in [the registry](../../pipelines/registry.json).

```sh
python3 tests/quality_gates/check_registry_consistency.py --strict-artifacts
python3 tests/quality_gates/run_gate.py 'codec=...+cnn=...+demosaic=...'
python3 tests/quality_gates/audit_ship_pipelines.py --strict
```

Use a full registry key, not the ellipsis above. Missing fixtures or checkpoints
mean the image gate has not run. Hosted CI checks registry structure and saved
signoffs; it is not a substitute for inference on the original images.

`preview_holdout_set.json` provides a broader informational set. Alternate sets
cannot replace the frozen gate or authorize `--claim`. External-receipt-only
paths have a separate runtime evaluation; the registry audit checks declarations,
not the contents of unmounted external dashboards.

## Evidence

`runs/*/run.json` preserves measured metrics and original run identities.
Machine-specific crop paths were relocated to repository-relative paths without
changing metrics or verdicts. Each relocated receipt records its original byte
hash and archive revision; the historical run ID is not a hash of the edited JSON.
Generated crops and visual differences are not bundled with these JSON receipts.
Regenerate them for visual review rather than treating absent media as verified.

[Quality signoffs](../../docs/claims_log.md) and
[release evidence](../../docs/release_evidence.json) summarize retained results.
Experimental diagnostics and iteration reports are preserved on the
[research archive branch](https://github.com/dcliftreaves/gpr/tree/archive/research-and-integration-2026-09-09).

Changes to thresholds belong in a separate, justified review, never in a cleanup
or as a way to make a failing model pass.
