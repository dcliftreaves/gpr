# Independent stock preview fixtures

These synthetic RGGB14 frames were encoded and decoded using unchanged codec
libraries from `6b22975dcf4e65ab9445852cd7b2220ae3faa3af`, before the cache-skewed
wavelet pitch changes. The instrumented reference encoder app only adds
quality selection; the libraries are unchanged. `vc5_rgb_reference.c` uses the
public decoder API without the new preview adapter. It produced the RGB24
goldens at 4×, 8× and 16× wavelet reduction using the stock SDK's default gains.

Every source pixel is `(x*123+y*97+x*y*29+(x^y)*37)&16383`, stored as
little-endian uint16. Dimensions 128×96 and 72×96 exercise aligned and odd
wavelet widths. `manifest.json` pins input, payload, probe and RGB hashes.
There is no photographic or external licensed image data in these fixtures.

Build the reference as described in `docs/stock-raw-video-12mp.md`, build the
probe against those reference libraries, then run:

```sh
GPR_BENCH_QUALITY=3 vc5_encoder_app -i source.raw -o NAME.vc5 -w WIDTH -h 96 -p PITCH
vc5_rgb_reference NAME.vc5 NAME-s4.rgb 4
vc5_rgb_reference NAME.vc5 NAME-s8.rgb 8
vc5_rgb_reference NAME.vc5 NAME-s16.rgb 16
```

`container-v3.gvid` is the independent Python `gvid3_test.py.fixture()` output.
Its payloads are plain synthetic byte strings, deliberately not VC-5. It tests
framing independently of the decoder and native container writer.
