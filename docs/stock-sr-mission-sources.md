# Mission 1 training-source availability and scene grouping

The archived Mission 1 corpus contains 42 distinct 8192x6144 little-endian RAW
count references. Every file is present, has the expected byte count and fits
the declared 14-bit domain. New SHA-256 values bind the exact cached arrays.
Their original GPR paths are currently unavailable, so this audit does not
claim a fresh independent decode of those original files.

The archived decode manifest records 40 successful decodes and two cached
entries. The first audit incorrectly assumed every entry had a fresh success
record and stopped at a cached entry; the corrected audit retains that distinction
and validates every cached array's current bytes/range. Archived timestamps,
model and ISO records are historical metadata, not newly extracted originals.

A contact sheet of sampled grayscale count previews was inspected for repeated
content. The 42 files represent approximately three coarse venues, with bursts
and repeated playground/home dates; they are not 42 independent scenes. A
conservative split for **future stock training** groups all playground dates
together, all home-interior dates together, and the lake sequence together:

| Group | Proposed split | References |
|---|---|---:|
| Playground across June 4/6/11/12 | Train | 28 |
| Home interiors across June 1/16 | Validation | 6 |
| Lake sequence on June 7 | Test | 8 |

All count hashes are unique; eleven conservative dHash similarity hints remain
inside these splits. This is not exhaustive near-duplicate exclusion. The same
people can appear across venues, and the contact sheet/count ranges were
inspected before the split; no pristine blind-test claim is made. No model has
been trained using this proposed split yet.

The three actually supplied GPRs separately have freshly extracted RGGB14
metadata with black level 16 and white level 16383. The recent Nikon-only
training/validation sources all have black 1008 and white 15892. That actual
camera-domain difference is relevant to future calibration-aware training;
source calibration equality within the Nikon set did not explain its own
shadow failures. The freshly supplied metadata does not establish per-frame
calibration for all 42 cached arrays. CFA/phase and calibration provenance
must be bound explicitly before future camera-quality claims.

[similarity hints](stock-sr-mission-source-receipts/similarity-hints.json),
[proposed groups](stock-sr-mission-source-receipts/scene-groups.json) and
[manifest](stock-sr-mission-source-receipts/manifest.json) preserve this evidence.
Photos and the visually inspected contact sheet stay external under
`/Volumes/OWC_8TB/gpr_work/artifacts/stock_sr_mission_sources_20261030`.
Camera GPR-derived arrays are compressed count references, not lossless sensor
truth. The existing supplied models are unchanged.
