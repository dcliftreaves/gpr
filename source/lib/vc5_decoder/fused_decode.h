/*! @file fused_decode.h
 *
 *  @brief Decoder for the fused encoder's self-describing wrapper format.
 *
 *  Pairs with the encoder in vc5_encoder/fused_encode.{c,h}. Reads the
 *  FUSED_HEADER + band manifest, decodes each rANS band stream via
 *  jans_decode_band_x4, inverse-quantizes and inverse-transforms 3
 *  levels of wavelet per channel, reverses the 4-channel color
 *  transform, applies the inverse log curve, and packs the result
 *  back into an RGGB / GBRG Bayer plane.
 *
 *  Only multi-level streams have enough information to reconstruct;
 *  single-level streams have no preserved lowpass and so cannot be
 *  decoded (the function returns -ENOTSUP in that case).

/* Decode a fused-encoder wrapped output back to a Bayer plane.

                   width * height * 2 bytes.
   bayer_pitch:    row stride in bytes (typically width * 2).

/* Half-resolution decode. Skips the level-1 inverse wavelet step, producing
   a bayer plane at (header.width / 2) × (header.height / 2). The level-1
   highpass bands stay in the bitstream — this path doesn't reconstruct them,
   so it's roughly 1.5–2× faster than full-resolution decode and produces
   output sized to feed a downstream CNN at codec-half-res (the pre-FUSED
   GPRCodec topology). bayer_out must be large enough for the half-res output;
   bayer_pitch_bytes is typically (header.width / 2) * 2. Returns 0 on
   success, negative on failure.

   Used by the gpr2prores playback pipeline. Only the multi-level path
   supports half_res; single-level + LL streams ignore the flag and decode
   at native dims. */
